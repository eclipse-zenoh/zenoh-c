/// Members:
///   void *context: a pointer to an arbitrary state.
///   void *call(const struct z_owned_reply_t*, const void *context): the typical callback function. `context` will be passed as its last argument.
///   void *drop(void*): allows the callback's state to be freed.
///
/// Closures are not guaranteed not to be called concurrently.
///
/// It is guaranteed that:
///
///   - `call` will never be called once `drop` has started.
///   - `drop` will only be called **once**, and **after every** `call` has ended.
///   - The two previous guarantees imply that `call` and `drop` are never called concurrently.
