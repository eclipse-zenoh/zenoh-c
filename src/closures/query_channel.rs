/// A closure is a structure that contains all the elements for stateful, memory-leak-free callbacks:
/// - `this` is a pointer to an arbitrary state.
/// - `call` is the typical callback function. `this` will be passed as its last argument.
/// - `drop` allows the callback's state to be freed.
///
/// Closures are not guaranteed not to be called concurrently.
///
/// We guarantee that:
/// - `call` will never be called once `drop` has started.
/// - `drop` will only be called ONCE, and AFTER EVERY `call` has ended.
/// - The two previous guarantees imply that `call` and `drop` are never called concurrently.
