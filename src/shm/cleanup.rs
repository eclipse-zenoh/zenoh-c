/// @warning This API has been marked as unstable: it works as advertised, but it may be changed in a future release.
/// @brief Linux: Trigger cleanup for orphaned SHM segments
/// If process that created named SHM segment crashes or exits by a signal, the segment persists in the system
/// disregarding if it is used by other Zenoh processes or not. This is the detail of POSIX specification for
/// shared memory that is hard to bypass. To deal with this we developed a cleanup routine that enumerates all
/// segments and tries to find processes that are using it. If no such process found, segment will be removed.
/// There is no ideal signal to trigger this cleanup, so by default, zenoh triggers it in the following moments:
/// - first POSIX SHM segment creation
/// - process exit via exit() call or return from maint function
///
/// It is OK to additionally trigger this function at any time, but be aware that this can be costly.
///
/// For non-linux platforms this function currently does nothing
